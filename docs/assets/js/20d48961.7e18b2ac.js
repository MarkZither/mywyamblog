Since I moved to Luxembourg I have grown to like Belgian Blondes like Brugse Zot and Trappist ales like Orval, so with my preferred flavour profile Christophe created a recipe on GrainFather, a Belgian Blonde inspired beer with a higher EBC and hopefully not too much banana.  ## The welcome  Before brewing we were treated to home made bread, honey from , ham, cheese, fruits and yoghurts, important to have a good feed before brewing, it is a not a short process and it is important to eat before trying the previous brews for future inspiration.  ## Hydration and energy  It is important to keep hydrated and energised while doing doing taxing jobs like water chemistry calculations and cranking the handle on the grain mill, we started that with a david629801, one of cha's previous brews, a fine West coast IPA to wake up the taste buds.  ## The water  Water makes up over 90% of beer and the levels of sulphates and chloride in the water will in part dictate the dryness, roundness and fullness of the beer.  This goes into the GrainMaster to come up to 66c ready for the mash.  ## The milling  The recipe calls for 4 fermentables, that is a grain which will provide the sugars for the yeast to ferment, we used;",l={authorsImageUrls:[void 0]},h=[{value:"Brew Day +1 - Fermentation",id:"brew-day-1---fermentation",level:2},{value:"Brew Day +5 - Cold Crash",id:"brew-day-5---cold-crash",level:2},{value:"Brew Day +7 - Kegging",id:"brew-day-7---kegging",level:2},{value:"Carbonation",id:"carbonation",level:2}];function d(e){const t={a:"a",h2:"h2",img:"img",li:"li",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Pale Ale Malt - 3.330 kg"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Pilsner Malt - 3.330 kg"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Munich Malt - Dark - 0.700 kg"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Caramel 100 - 38L - 0.150 kg"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Each bring different different characteristics to the beer."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"Network settings with 127.0.0.1 as DNS server",src:n(1394).A+"",width:"964",height:"1280"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"brew-day-1---fermentation",children:"Brew Day +1 - Fermentation"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After 24 hours at 22c"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)("video",{controls:!0,width:"250",children:[(0,i.jsx)("source",{src:"/img/videos/fermentation_bucket_with_airlock.mp4",type:"video/mp4"}),(0,i.jsx)("a",{href:"/img/videos/fermentation_bucket_with_airlock.mp4",children:"MP4 video"})]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"brew-day-5---cold-crash",children:"Brew Day +5 - Cold Crash"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Fermentation is complete, the warm uncarbonated beer is giving off boozy banana and spicy notes."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Taste wise it has a first hit of sweetness with a medium body.
