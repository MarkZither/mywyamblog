For me, as a .NET developer writing WPF applications, it was surprising to see it be reported repeatedly that our application was discovered to be written in Microsoft Visual C++ 8 and that we failed to implement protection like SafeSEH and ControlFlowGuard.  As much as I wanted to say wanted to say we don't write our software in C++ so these findings were not valid I dug deeper into the reports to understand why multiple pentests by multiple suppliers returned the same result.  ## Binary Identification",l={authorsImageUrls:[void 0]},p=[];function d(e){const t={a:"a",code:"code",img:"img",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["I have seen a few methods of identifying the language used to develop an application, first of which is ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https:/ntcore.com?page_id=388",children:"CFF Explorer"}),".  ### CFF Explorer  This has been used each time the binary has been misidentified as C++ when it was actually written in csharp, however it is not a fault with CFF Explorer, it is simply that the wrong executable had been analysed.
