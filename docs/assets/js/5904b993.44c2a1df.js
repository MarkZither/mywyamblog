In truth that also included belly flopping into the floor and crashing into the window and crumpling a little which caused me to drop quickly and get caught by Lane before I hit the floor again, not to mention the far from elegant wrestling to get me to the door at the end of my first go.  Somehow when you are in free fall those simple instructions I mentioned earlier become much more difficult, my eyes saw 2 straight fingers, but it took an age to convince my legs to move.  ## The Grand Finale\nThe HighFly, this was truly a heart in mouth stomach turning experience which I can't wait to do again."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)("video",{src:"/img/videos/Luxfly51MarkburtonTopHighFly.m4v",width:"75%",controls:!0,children:(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"If you are reading this, it is because your browser does not support the HTML5 video element"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.tvlux.be/video/info/arlon-le-luxfly-skydive-a-ouvert-ses-portes_34978.html",children:"https://www.tvlux.be/video/info/arlon-le-luxfly-skydive-a-ouvert-ses-portes_34978.html"})})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},28453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>s});var n=i(96540);const o={},r=n.createContext(o);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:a(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},77404:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/docs/blog/2021/06/11/my-first-skydive","editUrl":"https://github.com/MarkZither/mywyamblog/tree/main/docs/blog/2021-06-11-my-first-skydive.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-11-my-first-skydive.md","title":"My First Skydive @ LuxFly","description":"All the fun of skydiving without the danger of jumping out of a plane?","date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"LuxFly","permalink":"/docs/blog/tags/luxfly","description":"Luxembourg aviation"},{"inline":false,"label":"Skydiving","permalink":"/docs/blog/tags/skydiving","description":"Parachuting and skydiving"}],"readingTime":2.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Burton","title":"Software Engineer & Technical Writer","url":"https://github.com/MarkZither","imageURL":"https://github.com/MarkZither.png","key":"mark-burton","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"My First Skydive @ LuxFly","authors":["mark-burton"],"tags":["LuxFly","Skydiving"],"description":"All the fun of skydiving without the danger of jumping out of a plane?","date":"2021-06-11"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Centralizing VSTO add in exception management with postsharp 6","permalink":"/docs/blog/2021/06/18/centralizing-vsto-add-in-exception-management-with-postsharp6"},"nextItem":{"title":"KimaiDotNet based Office Add-ins","permalink":"/docs/blog/2021/05/29/KimaiDotNet-based-Office-Addins"}}')}}]);
