Today is the day before my hospital admission for aortic valve replacement surgery. After years of monitoring my bicuspid aortic valve and watching the stenosis gradually worsen, the time has come for the operation I've known was inevitable since childhood.

## The Lead-Up

As I mentioned in my [previous post about getting a new aortic valve](/blog/2025-09-28-getting-a-new-aortic-valve), I was born with a bicuspid aortic valve instead of the normal tricuspid valve. Over the years, the progressive stenosis has reached a point where replacement is necessary to maintain proper heart function.

The past few weeks have been filled with pre-operative assessments, consultations with the cardiac surgery team, and various medical tests to ensure everything is ready for tomorrow's admission.

## Pre-Operative Preparations

### Medical Preparations

The hospital provided a comprehensive checklist of things to prepare:

* **Final blood tests**: To check clotting factors and general health markers
* **ECG and chest X-ray**: Last-minute checks on heart function and lung condition
* **Medication adjustments**: Stopped certain medications as instructed, particularly blood thinners
* **Fasting instructions**: Clear guidelines on when to stop eating and drinking before surgery
* **COVID-19 and infection screening**: To ensure I'm fit for surgery

### Practical Preparations

Beyond the medical side, there's plenty of practical preparation:

* **Hospital bag packed**: Loose, comfortable clothing, toiletries, phone charger, and entertainment for recovery
* **House preparation**: Clean sheets ready for when I return, meals prepped and frozen
* **Work arrangements**: Everything handed over to colleagues, out-of-office messages set
* **Important documents**: Advanced directives, insurance information, emergency contacts all organized

### Mental Preparation

Perhaps the most important preparation is mental. I've watched the surgical videos, read the patient experiences, and spoken with others who've been through this procedure. While it's natural to feel some anxiety about major heart surgery, I'm feeling remarkably calm and confident in the surgical team.

The fact that this is now a routine procedure - performed thousands of times each year with excellent outcomes - is reassuring. Cardiac surgery has come such a long way, and the precision and skill involved is truly remarkable.

## What Happens Tomorrow

Tomorrow morning, I'll be admitted to the cardiac ward. The process typically involves:

1. **Admission and pre-op checks**: Final vitals, consent forms, meeting with the anaesthetist
2. **Preparation**: Changed into surgical gown, IV line inserted, pre-medication if needed
3. **Transfer to theatre**: Moving to the operating theatre when it's time
4. **The operation**: 3-4 hours of surgery while on cardiopulmonary bypass
5. **Recovery**: Waking up in ICU with various monitoring equipment

## The Surgery Itself

The aortic valve replacement procedure involves:

* Opening the chest through a median sternotomy (splitting the breastbone)
* Connecting to the heart-lung bypass machine
* Stopping the heart temporarily
* Removing the diseased bicuspid valve
* Sewing in the new prosthetic valve
* Restarting the heart
* Closing the chest

If you're interested in the technical details, I linked to an excellent surgical animation in my [previous post](/blog/2025-09-28-getting-a-new-aortic-valve).

## Expected Recovery Timeline

The cardiac team has outlined what to expect:

* **Days 1-3**: ICU recovery, extubation, starting to sit up
* **Days 4-7**: Move to cardiac ward, start walking with physiotherapy
* **Week 2-6**: Home recovery, gradually increasing activity
* **Week 6-12**: Cardiac rehabilitation program
* **3+ months**: Return to normal activities, including work

## Following My Progress

I'll be documenting the recovery journey here on the blog as I'm able. My partner will post updates on the first few days when I'm still in ICU and unable to write myself.

## Final Thoughts

It's a strange feeling knowing that tomorrow my heart will be stopped, my chest will be opened, and a skilled surgeon will replace a valve I was born with. But it's also exciting - after this, I'll have a properly functioning aortic valve for the first time in my life.

Modern cardiac surgery is truly miraculous. I'm grateful to live in an era where this procedure is not only possible but routine, and I have complete confidence in the medical team taking care of me.

See you on the other side!
