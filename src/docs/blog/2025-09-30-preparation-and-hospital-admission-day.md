Today I was admitted to hospital for aortic valve replacement surgery. After years of monitoring my bicuspid aortic valve and watching the stenosis gradually worsen, the time has come for the operation I've known was inevitable since childhood.

## The Lead-Up

As I mentioned in my [previous post about getting a new aortic valve](/blog/2025-09-28-getting-a-new-aortic-valve), I was born with a bicuspid aortic valve instead of the normal tricuspid valve. Over the years, the progressive stenosis has reached a point where replacement is necessary to maintain proper heart function.

The past few weeks have been filled with pre-operative assessments, consultations with the cardiac surgery team, and various medical tests to ensure everything is ready for tomorrow's admission.

## Pre-Operative Preparations

### Medical Preparations

The hospital provided a comprehensive checklist of things to prepare:

* **Final blood tests**: To check clotting factors and general health markers
* **ECG and chest X-ray**: Last-minute checks on heart function and lung condition
* **Medication adjustments**: Stopped certain medications as instructed, particularly blood thinners
* **Fasting instructions**: Clear guidelines on when to stop eating and drinking before surgery
* **COVID-19 and infection screening**: To ensure I'm fit for surgery

### Practical Preparations

Beyond the medical side, there's plenty of practical preparation:

* **Hospital bag packed**: Loose, comfortable clothing, toiletries, phone charger, and entertainment for recovery
* **House preparation**: Clean sheets ready for when I return, meals prepped and frozen
* **Work arrangements**: Everything handed over to colleagues, out-of-office messages set
* **Important documents**: Advanced directives, insurance information, emergency contacts all organized

### Mental Preparation

Perhaps the most important preparation is mental. I've watched the surgical videos, read the patient experiences, and spoken with others who've been through this procedure. While it's natural to feel some anxiety about major heart surgery, I'm feeling remarkably calm and confident in the surgical team.

The fact that this is now a routine procedure - performed thousands of times each year with excellent outcomes - is reassuring. Cardiac surgery has come such a long way, and the precision and skill involved is truly remarkable.

## Hospital Check-In - 13:00

Check-in was prompt and efficient. The cardiac ward staff were welcoming and immediately got to work with the pre-operative assessments:

* **Blood pressure**: 150/80 - slightly elevated but expected given the circumstances
* **Blood tests**: Taken for final clotting factors and general health markers
* **Chest X-ray**: Completed to check heart size and lung condition

Throughout the afternoon, I was visited by various members of the surgical team, each explaining their role in tomorrow's procedure:

* **Surgical assistant**: Walked through the procedure timeline and what to expect
* **Anaesthesiologist**: Discussed anaesthesia plan and post-operative pain management
* **Surgeon**: The most important conversation - explaining the surgical approach

## A Welcome Change in Surgical Plan

The surgeon brought excellent news about the surgical approach. Instead of the full median sternotomy (completely splitting the breastbone) that I'd been preparing for, the plan is now:

* **Smaller incision**: A more minimally invasive approach
* **Partial sternotomy**: Only a partial cut of the sternum rather than the full split

This is fantastic news because it means:

* **Quicker healing**: Less trauma to the chest wall
* **Reduced complications**: Lower risk of sternal instability during recovery
* **Better outcomes**: Generally improved recovery experience

I'm relieved and grateful that this less invasive option is possible in my case.

## Pre-Surgery Meal Plan

The nursing staff provided clear instructions for the hours leading up to surgery:

* **18:00 (6 PM)**: Light meal - my last food before surgery
* **22:00 (10 PM)**: Nothing to eat or drink after this time
* **08:00 (8 AM)**: Planned surgery start time tomorrow morning

I was given a bottle of water to stay hydrated through the evening, and I'm making the most of being able to have that light meal later.

## The Surgery Tomorrow

Tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM, I'll have the aortic valve replacement. The updated surgical approach involves:

* **Smaller incision**: More minimally invasive than traditional approach
* **Partial sternotomy**: Only a partial cut of the sternum instead of full median sternotomy
* **Heart-lung bypass**: Connecting to the bypass machine
* **Valve replacement**: Removing the diseased bicuspid valve and sewing in the new prosthetic valve
* **Recovery start**: Waking up in ICU with monitoring equipment

The benefits of this modified approach include quicker healing and less chance of complications with sternal instability.

If you're interested in the technical details of traditional valve replacement, I linked to an excellent surgical animation in my [previous post](/blog/2025-09-28-getting-a-new-aortic-valve).

## Expected Recovery Timeline

The cardiac team has outlined what to expect:

* **Days 1-3**: ICU recovery, extubation, starting to sit up
* **Days 4-7**: Move to cardiac ward, start walking with physiotherapy
* **Week 2-6**: Home recovery, gradually increasing activity
* **Week 6-12**: Cardiac rehabilitation program
* **3+ months**: Return to normal activities, including work

## Following My Progress

I'll be documenting the recovery journey here on the blog as I'm able. My partner will post updates on the first few days when I'm still in ICU and unable to write myself.

## Reflections from the Hospital Ward

It's now evening in the cardiac ward, and I'm feeling calm and ready. The fact that the surgical team has opted for the less invasive approach is reassuring - it speaks to their confidence in achieving a good outcome with reduced trauma to my chest.

The nursing staff have been excellent, the ward is quiet and well-run, and I have complete confidence in tomorrow's procedure. The next update will likely come from my partner while I'm in recovery.

Modern cardiac surgery truly is remarkable. I'm grateful for the skilled team, the advanced techniques that make this minimally invasive approach possible, and for living in an era where this life-changing procedure is routine.

See you on the other side!
