## Tuesday, 8th October 2025

The real day 5 of recovery - my first full day on the normal ward after yesterday's move.

## Early Morning Wake-Up

Same as yesterday, there was nothing going on at 5:30. Unfortunately, I had woken up with a headache, so I buzzed for a nurse to request paracetamol and went back to sleep.

The next noise I heard was breakfast being put on the table. The nurse did the routine checks, and the doctors were on their way in.

## Surgeon's Reassurance

The surgeon was reassuring that I was experiencing common phenomena amongst younger aortic valve replacement patients. While the exact mechanics might not be clearly understood, the heart just got a significant upgrade and occasionally it will skip a beat. In his experience, this is a fairly simple fix: keep drinking plenty of water and doing plenty of walking. I am back on the mobile pacemaker just to be sure.

## Breakfast and Dietary Improvements

Breakfast was uninspiring, but the food here since I have been off the terrible no-residual diet has been pretty good - even a menu with a couple of choices and a vegetarian option.

## Morning Physiotherapy Session

Once I had got ready, I went for a short stroll. Almost straight away I saw the physio, so I went back to my room to wait for them. Before the physio arrived, I was told I had an X-ray booked and I was to go straight away with a chaperone.

### X-ray Journey

We passed the physio on the way, and when I said I was going for an X-ray, she took over the chaperone job. We walked to the X-ray department at quite a clip whilst I explained a bit about my elevated heart rate to the physio.

The X-ray was super quick, and the physio guided me back via a flight of stairs. Made it all the way up today! Back to my room, and I discovered that I even scored one Fit Bit heart point - my first one post-surgery!

## Afternoon Rest and Activities

Time for a bit of a relax. I did breathing exercises and short walks until lunch arrived. After more relaxing, the physio was back for another session on the stairs.

Three of us from the ward congregated at the top of the stairs for a rest. I won first place for highest heart rate, but my only prize was more loud heart noises in my head.

## Progress Summary

Day 5 on the normal ward:

* ✅ Managing post-operative headaches
* ✅ Continuing with mobile pacemaker for elevated heart rate monitoring
* ✅ Increased walking and stair climbing
* ✅ First Fit Bit heart point post-surgery
* ✅ Multiple physiotherapy sessions
* ✅ Improved dietary options
* ⏳ Monitoring elevated heart rate (common in younger valve replacement patients)

The elevated heart rate episodes are concerning but apparently normal for younger patients after valve replacement. The medical team's approach of increased hydration and walking, combined with pacemaker monitoring, provides reassurance that this is a manageable aspect of recovery.

## Reflections on Progress

It's encouraging to see daily improvements in mobility, even though the elevated heart rate is a reminder that recovery isn't always linear. The ability to climb a full flight of stairs and earn that first fitness point felt like a real achievement, even if it came with some uncomfortable sensations.

The physiotherapy team's consistent attention and the surgeon's reassurance help maintain confidence that these temporary setbacks are part of the normal healing process for someone my age going through this procedure.
