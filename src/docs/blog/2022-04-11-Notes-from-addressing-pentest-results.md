# Understanding Penetration Test Reports as a developer  In the Pentest reports I have read it has been common for the first section to be about identifying the technology the application is written in, this is used to make some initial suggestions on shortcomings in the application.  For me, as a .NET developer writing WPF applications, it was surprising to see it be reported repeatedly that our application was discovered to be written in Microsoft Visual C++ 8 and that we failed to implement protection like SafeSEH and ControlFlowGuard.  As much as I wanted to say wanted to say we don't write our software in C++ so these findings were not valid I dug deeper into the reports to understand why multiple pentests by multiple suppliers returned the same result.  ## Binary Identification
I have seen a few methods of identifying the language used to develop an application, first of which is [CFF Explorer](https:/ntcore.com?page_id=388).  ### CFF Explorer  This has been used each time the binary has been misidentified as C++ when it was actually written in csharp, however it is not a fault with CFF Explorer, it is simply that the wrong executable had been analysed.  ![Select file](/img/CFF_Explorer_Squirrel_Executable_Location.png)

mburton@zitherldwx01:mntc/UsersanonAppDataLocalWpfSampleAppFullFramework$ ls
Update.exe  WpfApp2FullFramework.exe  app-1.0.0  packages  mburton@zitherldwx01:mntc/UsersanonAppDataLocalWpfSampleAppFullFramework$ file WpfApp2FullFramework.exe

## Binary Security  Having identified the binary the reports then flag security options which have not been used. This can be done using a PowerShell Module [PESecurity](https:/github.comNetSPIPESecurity.git)  <p className="alert alert-warning" />WARNING!!! Use [PESecurity](https:/github.comNetSPIPESecurity.git) at your own risk, read the code yourself before you use it!<<p className="alert alert-warning"> />

<p> <p>  ``` powershell  PS C:\Source\GitRepos\PESecurity> Get-PESecurity -file $env:LOCALAPPDATA\WpfSampleAppFullFramework\app-1.0.0\WpfApp2FullFramework.exe  FileName  : $env:LOCALAPPDATA\WpfSampleAppFullFramework\app-1.0.0\WpfApp2FullFramework.exe

```  ## The Cause of the misidentification  The application installer is built using [Squirrel](https:/github.comSquirrelSquirrel.Windows), the file being opened in `CFF Explorer` is part of the Squirrel installer as described in the [Installing Documentation](https:/github.comSquirrelSquirrel.Windowsblobdevelopdocsgetting-started4-installing.md).  The actual application executable is in the application version subdirectory `app-n.n.n`.  ## How to fix it?  I had a very constructive discussion with [caesay](https:/github.comcaesay) who is one of the maintainers of [Clowd.Squirrel](https:/github.comclowdClowd.Squirrel), a fork of [Squirrel.Windows](https:/github.comSquirrelSquirrel.Windows) moments after our discussion this commit [Enable ControlFlowGuard for Setup.exe](https:/github.comclowdClowd.Squirrelcommit5cb8fdd8be220167e65af5f43a521c4307bd783a) was made.
