Monday, 7th October 2025 - My first full day on the normal ward brought different routines and expectations. The focus shifted to increased mobility and continued monitoring of my heart's adaptation to its new hardware.

## The Missing EEG

On the normal ward, the day was quite different. At least on this first full day, I was waiting for my 5:30 EEG but nothing happened. Which was kind of annoying because I had not slept well and was ready to be helped out of bed. As it happened, I probably fell asleep for probably my best hour of sleep of the night. No idea what the lack of sleep was all about really.

## Morning Visits

Quiet morning until the surgeon arrived at about the same time as my breakfast and a nurse to do my blood pressure and heart rate. My surgeon got priority. He explained they are still monitoring my heart, which is expectedly tachycardic after the surgery, to get the beta blocker dose right to allow the heart to reconfigure itself to its new hardware. He made it clear I should walk a lot more today.

Before breakfast, the blood pressure was taken and the mobile pacemaker disconnected. The cables remain hanging out of me - they should be removed in the next couple of days.

## Physiotherapy Session

After breakfast I went for a short walk and nearly missed my physio. I was taken to the stairs where I walked half a flight of stairs basically unaided. I felt OK, but my heart rate had jumped to 125 from my current resting 95/100 (ish), so we left it there for today and descended the stairs and headed back to the room for breathing exercises.

The breathing exercises included one new one: breathe in fully and hold it for 3 seconds. Like most of the breathing exercises, it was extremely hard at first, but throughout the day it is getting less painful to do.

## Echocardiogram Results

Before I could even finish my shower, I had a knock on the door. It was time for an echo to have a look at how the new heart hardware was bedding in. Another positive outcome - the heart looks good and the valve looks good. It is a very different squelch sound now on the echocardiogram with the artificial valve.

Not sure if it was something seen on the echo, but the doctor told me I should drink more. I thought it was a bit early in my recovery and the day for a drink. A moment later she clarified "water only".

## Progress Notes

The transition to the normal ward marks a significant step in the recovery process. The focus on increased mobility and the positive echocardiogram results are encouraging signs that the heart is adapting well to the new valve.
