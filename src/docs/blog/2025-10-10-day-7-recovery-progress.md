## Friday, 10th October - Day 7 Post-Operation

A week has passed since my aortic valve replacement surgery, and the progress has been remarkable. Today marks another significant milestone in my recovery journey as I continue to build independence and prepare for the next phase of healing at home.

## Morning Routine

The morning started with the familiar routine - early ECG and vital signs monitoring. By now, I've become accustomed to the 5:30 AM wake-up call from the night shift nurses. The surgeon's rounds brought encouraging news about my progress and initial discussions about discharge planning.

## Physical Progress

### Mobility Improvements

My walking distance has increased significantly. Today's physiotherapy session included:

* Multiple walks along the hospital corridor
* Navigating stairs under supervision
* Practising movements needed for daily life at home
* Continued breathing exercises with the Mediflo Duo at level 4 of 5

The improvement in stamina is noticeable. What exhausted me completely just a few days ago now feels manageable, though I still need frequent rests.

### Pain Management

Pain levels continue to decrease. I'm now managing with regular paracetamol and only occasional stronger medication. The chest incision is healing well, and the discomfort from coughing and movement is much more tolerable.

The bracing technique with the recovery gilet has become second nature. I can now:

* Get in and out of bed independently
* Stand up from chairs without assistance
* Walk short distances without support
* Perform daily activities with minimal pain

## Medical Updates

### Pacemaker Removal

The temporary pacemaker cables were finally removed today. This was another major milestone - no more carrying around the Osypka device! The removal was quick but uncomfortable, similar to other tube removals I've experienced this week.

With the pacemaker cables gone, I'm down to just the portable heart monitor around my neck. My heart rhythm has remained stable throughout recovery, which is excellent news.

### Medication Adjustments

The medical team has finalised my discharge medication plan:

* Anticoagulants (blood thinners) - critical for the mechanical valve
* Beta-blockers for heart rate control
* Pain relief as needed
* Diuretics to manage any remaining fluid retention

I've been receiving education about the importance of anticoagulation therapy and the need for regular INR monitoring after discharge.

## Preparing for Home

### Discharge Planning

The discharge planning process began in earnest today. The nursing staff provided guidance on:

* Wound care and infection signs to watch for
* Activity restrictions during the recovery period
* Medication management
* Follow-up appointments
* Warning signs that require immediate medical attention

### Practical Considerations

I've been practising activities I'll need to do at home:

* Getting dressed without help
* Managing personal hygiene
* Walking short distances
* Using stairs safely
* Sleeping in different positions

The occupational therapist provided advice on arranging the home environment to support safe recovery.

## Mental and Emotional Progress

Seven days in, the emotional rollercoaster of recovery continues. There's excitement about going home mixed with anxiety about managing without the constant medical support. The nursing staff have been reassuring, emphasising that this reaction is completely normal.

I'm feeling more like myself mentally. The post-surgical fog has largely lifted, though I still tire easily and need regular rest periods.

## Breathing Exercises

The breathing exercises remain a crucial part of each day. I'm now consistently achieving good results on the Mediflo Duo at level 4. Deep breathing is still uncomfortable but no longer agonising. The improvement in lung capacity is encouraging and the medical team are pleased with my respiratory progress.

## Progress Summary

Day 7 represents significant achievements:

* ✅ One week post-surgery milestone reached
* ✅ Temporary pacemaker cables removed
* ✅ Walking independently with good stamina
* ✅ Pain well controlled with basic medication
* ✅ Getting in and out of bed without assistance
* ✅ Discharge planning underway
* ✅ Increased lung capacity and better breathing
* ✅ All tubes and lines removed except heart monitor

## Looking Ahead

Discharge is likely within the next few days, possibly as soon as tomorrow or Saturday. The focus now shifts from hospital recovery to preparing for the longer rehabilitation journey at home.

The surgical team have emphasised that whilst I've made excellent progress, the real recovery work continues for the next 6-12 weeks. Activities will be restricted, and I'll need to build stamina gradually whilst the sternum heals completely.

I'm grateful for the exceptional care I've received at INCCI and feel well-prepared for the next phase of recovery. A week ago, I was waking up from major surgery; now I'm preparing to return home. It's remarkable progress, and I'm optimistic about continuing to heal.

## Reflection

Looking back at the past week - from the intensive care unit to intermediate care to the normal ward - the journey has been challenging but ultimately positive. Each day has brought small victories, and the cumulative effect is transformative.

The support from the medical staff, my family, and friends has been invaluable. Recovery from cardiac surgery is not just a physical journey but an emotional and psychological one as well. Having that support network makes all the difference.

As I prepare to leave the hospital, I'm focused on following the medical team's guidance, being patient with the recovery process, and celebrating each small step forward.
