## Morning Routine in Intermediate Care

The pattern had become familiar by now - the night shift nurses arrived at 5:30 AM and had to wake me for the daily ECG. After another snooze, a whole new team of nurses arrived for the day shift. Unlike previous days, there was no X-ray scheduled today as far as I recall.

I was gotten ready for the surgeon's visit, who arrived with a big team of doctors and students in tow. He asked me if I needed the oxygen anymore. I gave an honest shrug - "I don't know." He told me he would check and, after confirming my oxygen levels were good, ordered the oxygen removed. Then came the good news: they were preparing a new room for me in the standard care ward.

## The Move Across the Hall

No sooner had I finished my breakfast than a team of nurses arrived to move me to my new room. The journey wasn't far - all the way directly across the hall!

The transition brought several welcome changes:

* **Oxygen line removed**: No longer needed, confirming my lungs were recovering well
* **Heart monitor upgrade**: The continual monitoring equipment shrank to a portable Phillips MX40-2C4 that I can carry around my neck. It still sends all the data to the central nurse station, but I'm no longer tethered to a bedside machine
* **Mobile pacemaker**: I still have to carry this around as well, though they mentioned it would be removed in the next day or two

## The Temporary Pacemaker

The mobile pacemaker is a slightly weird experience. The cables run inside me to somewhere close to my heart - you can find information about what colour wires do what if you're curious. The device allows the medical team to speed up or slow down my heart if needed, though to my knowledge it hasn't been used yet. Having those cables inside is an odd sensation, but it's temporary and an important safety measure during recovery.

## Life in the Normal Ward

Now I'm in a nice quiet room alone. No more beeping machines, though there are still plenty of nurse visits, tests, and medicine to take. The quieter environment is a welcome change after the hectic intermediate care ward.

## Physiotherapy and Breathing Exercises

The physio took me for a walk down the corridor, which went well. My mobility is improving daily.

She also gave me some more advanced breathing exercises to do. These are crucial because of the discomfort and reduced activity - the temptation is to breathe superficially, which is bad for recovery. Shallow breathing allows bad stuff to build up, leading to coughing (which rates 10 out of 10 on the pain scale, even in the special braced position) and worse possibilities like infection if I don't do the breathing exercises properly and keep my airways clear.

Despite the pain, I'm committed to doing the breathing exercises regularly. They're an essential part of preventing complications.

## Progress Summary

Day 5 marks a significant milestone in my recovery:

* ✅ Moved to normal ward
* ✅ Oxygen support no longer needed
* ✅ Portable monitoring equipment
* ✅ Increased mobility with corridor walks
* ✅ Advanced breathing exercises
* ⏳ Temporary pacemaker still in place (removal soon)

The steady progression from intensive care to intermediate care and now to the normal ward shows good recovery. Each day brings more independence and fewer machines, though the vigilant medical monitoring continues to ensure everything heals properly.
