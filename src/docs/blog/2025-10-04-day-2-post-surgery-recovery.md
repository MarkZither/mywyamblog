Saturday, 4th October 2025 - Day 2 after my aortic valve replacement surgery. Today brought significant progress in my recovery, from early morning monitoring through to standing up under my own power for the first time.

## Early Morning Routine

The day started early at 5:30 AM with an ECG whilst still in bed. This was followed by an X-ray around 7:00 AM, also conducted bedside. These morning tests are a routine part of post-operative monitoring to check heart function and lung condition after cardiac surgery.

## Surgeon's Visit

The surgeon came to visit and confirmed that my drainage tube would be removed. The drainage tube had been collecting excess fluid from around the surgical site, and its removal is a significant milestone in the recovery process.

The removal itself felt rather gross as it was pulled out - there's simply no way to make extracting a tube from your chest comfortable. However, almost instantly I could breathe easier with much less pain. The difference was remarkable and immediate.

## Breathing Exercises

I worked with my breathing machine (incentive spirometer) both before and after the drainage tube was removed. The difference was huge. With the tube in place, each breath had been limited by discomfort and the physical presence of the tube. Once removed, my lung capacity improved dramatically.

A little later, the physiotherapist came for our session. It was amazing how much better my breathing was compared to yesterday's sessions. The improvement in lung function after drainage tube removal was substantial and encouraging.

## First Time Standing

Lunch came around at 12:30. Whilst the nurse helped me swing my legs off the bed, I stood up under my own power for the first time since surgery. This is a crucial milestone in cardiac recovery - getting vertical helps with circulation, breathing, and reducing the risk of complications from prolonged bed rest.

The nursing staff were supportive throughout, ensuring I moved safely whilst encouraging independence where possible.

## Recovery Progress

According to the expected timeline from my [pre-surgery post](/blog/2025-09-30-preparation-and-hospital-admission-day), Days 2-3 involve continued ICU care with progressive mobilisation. Standing up today marks excellent progress towards that goal.

Each small step forward - the tube removal, improved breathing, standing up - builds confidence and demonstrates that the recovery is progressing as planned.

## Looking Forward

The focus now is on continuing to improve breathing capacity, increasing mobility, and working towards transfer to intermediate care in the coming days. Each day should bring new progress and increased independence.
