## OpenVAS

### Task 1 - 6 Introduction

Read tasks 1 - 6 for an introduction to OpenVAS and instructions on setting it up.

As I already have a dedicated Kali VM running I went for the Install from Kali/OpenVAS repositories approach and use the [Install from Kali/OpenVAS repositories](https://www.agix.com.au/installing-openvas-on-kali-in-2020/) guide, as of June 2023
