## Sunday, 13th October 2025 - Day 10

Day 10 was a very quiet day, two days after the pacemaker surgery. The focus was on waiting for news about the next stage of my recovery journey, though the delay in transferring to Kirchberg felt frustrating as it meant another day before ultimately getting home.

## Waiting for Transfer News

The doctors did their rounds at about 10:30. Unfortunately, they confirmed what I feared - Kirchberg didn't have a bed available today. However, my move to Kirchberg is confirmed for tomorrow, so at least I have the certainty now that I will be transferred. Knowing the plan, even if delayed by a day, provides peace of mind.

The doctor did tell me that if I have visitors today, I am permitted to go to the café with them downstairs, which would be the first time I have been out of the ward, apart from for tests, since I entered the hospital 11 days ago. After so long confined to the ward, the prospect of simply sitting in a café felt like a significant milestone.

## An Afternoon of Freedom

At 15:00 some friends came to visit, and I was allowed out! I had a frothy coffee, a cold sparkling water and very pleasant catch-up. It was wonderful to have a change of scenery and to spend time with friends outside the clinical environment of the ward. These small moments of normalcy are incredibly valuable during a long hospital stay.

## Day 10 Summary

Key developments on Day 10:

* ✅ Transfer to Kirchberg confirmed for Monday (Day 11)
* ✅ First permission to leave the ward for social visits
* ✅ Successful café visit with friends - first time out in 11 days
* ✅ Quiet day allowing continued recovery from pacemaker surgery

Whilst the delay was frustrating as it meant spending another day in hospital and delaying my eventual return home, the confirmation of tomorrow's transfer at least provided certainty about the next step. The café visit offered a welcome break from the ward environment.

## Monday, 14th October 2025 - Day 11

As expected today, I moved from INCCI to Kirchberg after I had eaten my breakfast and had clean dressings put on.

## The Last Walk and Sudden Departure

The physio arrived for a last walk, but just as I said I think I have time, the transport arrived so we had to skip the walk. My belongings were stuffed into my bags and I was wheeled out of INCCI and into a luxambulance for my transfer to Kirchberg.

## Transfer to Kirchberg

Traffic wasn't terrible - 20 minutes later I was wheeled into the cardiology ward in Kirchberg hospital, a somewhat calmer vibe than INCCI. My vital stats were checked and tested to the mobile heart monitor. Today is for monitoring and continuation of the care from INCCI. Tomorrow morning I will meet my cardiologist, after which there should be a clearer plan for my stay and hopefully a confirmed day for returning home - please let it be Wednesday.

## Day 11 Summary

Key developments on Day 11:

* ✅ Final breakfast and dressing change at INCCI
* ✅ Planned physio walk cancelled due to early transport arrival
* ✅ Successfully transferred to Kirchberg hospital via luxambulance (20 minutes)
* ✅ Settled into cardiology ward with calmer atmosphere
* ✅ Vital signs monitoring and mobile heart monitor setup
* ✅ Awaiting cardiologist consultation on Day 12

The move to Kirchberg marks a significant transition in my recovery - from the acute intensive care environment at INCCI to the specialist cardiac monitoring that will bridge the gap between hospital care and returning home.

## Progress Summary

Days 10-12 represent a crucial transition phase in my recovery - from the frustrating delay after pacemaker surgery, through the transfer from acute care at INCCI to specialist cardiac monitoring at Kirchberg, where my cardiologist will finalise the plan for discharge and return to normal life.

The café visit on Day 10 was a poignant reminder that recovery isn't just about medical milestones, but also about reconnecting with normal life, one small step at a time. The transfer on Day 11 moved me to the next stage of care, though the overall handover process felt like it could have been smoother.
