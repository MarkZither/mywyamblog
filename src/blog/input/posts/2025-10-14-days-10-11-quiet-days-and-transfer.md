## Sunday, 13th October 2025 - Day 10

Day 10 was a very quiet day, a welcome respite after the intensity of the pacemaker surgery the day before. The focus was on waiting for news about the next stage of my recovery journey.

## Waiting for Transfer News

The doctors did their rounds at about 10:30. Unfortunately, they confirmed what I feared - Kirchberg didn't have a bed available today. However, my move to Kirchberg is confirmed for tomorrow, so at least I have the certainty now that I will be transferred. Knowing the plan, even if delayed by a day, provides peace of mind.

The doctor did tell me that if I have visitors today, I am permitted to go to the café with them downstairs, which would be the first time I have been out of the ward, apart from for tests, since I entered the hospital 11 days ago. After so long confined to the ward, the prospect of simply sitting in a café felt like a significant milestone.

## An Afternoon of Freedom

At 15:00 some friends came to visit, and I was allowed out! I had a frothy coffee, a cold sparkling water and very pleasant catch-up. It was wonderful to have a change of scenery and to spend time with friends outside the clinical environment of the ward. These small moments of normalcy are incredibly valuable during a long hospital stay.

## Day 10 Summary

Key developments on Day 10:

* ✅ Transfer to Kirchberg confirmed for Monday (Day 11)
* ✅ First permission to leave the ward for social visits
* ✅ Successful café visit with friends - first time out in 11 days
* ✅ Quiet day allowing continued recovery from pacemaker surgery

After the intensity of additional surgery, this quieter day was exactly what I needed. The confirmation of tomorrow's transfer gives a clear path forward to the next phase of recovery under my cardiologist's care.

## Progress Summary

Days 10-11 represent a transition phase in my recovery - from the acute care setting where I received my emergency pacemaker to the specialist cardiac care at Kirchberg where my cardiologist can provide ongoing monitoring and prepare me for discharge home.

The café visit on Day 10 was a poignant reminder that recovery isn't just about medical milestones, but also about reconnecting with normal life, one small step at a time.
