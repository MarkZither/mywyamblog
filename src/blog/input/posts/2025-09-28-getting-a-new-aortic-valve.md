## The Biology Bit

Most people are born with a tricuspid aortic valve - that's a valve with three leaflets that open and close to control blood flow from the heart's left ventricle into the aorta. I was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, which means mine only has two leaflets instead of three.

This might sound like a minor difference, but it's a bit like having a door that's missing one of its hinges - it still works, but it doesn't work as well and it wears out faster. The two leaflets have to do the work of three, and over time they tend to become thickened and calcified, gradually restricting blood flow. This progressive narrowing is called aortic stenosis.

My bicuspid valve was discovered when I was a small child at Leicester's Groby Road Hospital. The doctors explained that this is actually quite common - about 1-2% of people have bicuspid aortic valves - but it does mean a lifetime of monitoring and, eventually, the need for replacement surgery when the stenosis becomes severe enough to affect heart function.

## Understanding Aortic Stenosis

If you're interested in learning more about the condition, this YouTube video provides an excellent overview of aortic stenosis, including what the characteristic heart murmurs sound like. It's quite technical but very well explained by a cardiologist:

## The Surgery - What Actually Happens

Now, if you want to see exactly what they'll be doing to me during the operation, this surgical animation shows the entire aortic valve replacement procedure in rather graphic detail. Dr. Shipley's animation is medically accurate and shows every step from opening the chest to sewing everything back up again.

Fair warning: this is definitely not for the squeamish. We're talking about opening the ribcage, stopping the heart, cutting out the old valve, and sewing in a new one. It's fascinating from a medical perspective, and whilst it might seem daunting to watch when you know you'll be the one on the table, I found it absolutely amazing. The precision and skill involved is remarkable, and it reinforces my complete confidence in these medical professionals.

If you do watch it, you'll understand why cardiac surgeons are held in such high regard - the precision required is extraordinary, and the fact that this is now a routine procedure (performed thousands of times each year) is a testament to how far cardiac surgery has advanced.
