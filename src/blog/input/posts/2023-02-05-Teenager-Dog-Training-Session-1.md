# Teenager Dog Training Session 1

The first day of the teenager dog training was mainly a recap of previous training and to check level of the dogs and trainers.

## Sitting while trainer walks around

## Walking forward and turning

With the dog on your left, lead in right hand and treat in left hand. Always lead of with left leg, this will become a signal for the dog to walk with you, while leading with the right leg can be a signal the dog is to stay.

Only turn right, lead the dog with the treat, as the dog starts to come naturally slightly withhold the treat.

It is important to be careful with the timing of the delivery of the treat, only give the treat when the dog has all 4 paws on the ground in the correct position to your left

## Playing with pull toy

Move the pull toy across the ground to trigger the dogs chase instinct/prey drive.

Let the dog take the toy, now, the important part is that the dog brings the pull toy back to play more. Do not leave the pull toy with the dog to destroy.

## Playing with tennis balls

Roll the balls across each other in front of the dog to see if they are interested.

## Walking in a figure of 8
With the dog on your left, lead in right hand and treat in left hand.
