## Day 5: Wednesday, 8th October 2025

My first full day on the normal ward after yesterday's move.

## Early Morning Wake-Up

Same as yesterday, there was nothing going on at 5:30. Unfortunately, I had woken up with a headache, so I buzzed for a nurse to request paracetamol and went back to sleep.

The next noise I heard was breakfast being put on the table. The nurse did the routine checks, and the doctors were on their way in.

## Surgeon's Reassurance

The surgeon was reassuring that I was experiencing common phenomena amongst younger aortic valve replacement patients. While the exact mechanics might not be clearly understood, the heart just got a significant upgrade and occasionally it will skip a beat. In his experience, this is a fairly simple fix: keep drinking plenty of water and doing plenty of walking. I am back on the mobile pacemaker just to be sure.

## Breakfast and Dietary Improvements

Breakfast was uninspiring, but the food here since I have been off the terrible no-residual diet has been pretty good - even a menu with a couple of choices and a vegetarian option.

## Morning Physiotherapy Session

Once I had got ready, I went for a short stroll. Almost straight away I saw the physio, so I went back to my room to wait for them. Before the physio arrived, I was told I had an X-ray booked and I was to go straight away with a chaperone.

### X-ray Journey

We passed the physio on the way, and when I said I was going for an X-ray, she took over the chaperone job. We walked to the X-ray department at quite a clip whilst I explained a bit about my elevated heart rate to the physio.

The X-ray was super quick, and the physio guided me back via a flight of stairs. Made it all the way up today! Back to my room, and I discovered that I even scored one Fit Bit heart point - my first one post-surgery!

## Afternoon Rest and Activities

Time for a bit of a relax. I did breathing exercises and short walks until lunch arrived. After more relaxing, the physio was back for another session on the stairs.

Three of us from the ward congregated at the top of the stairs for a rest. I won first place for highest heart rate, but my only prize was more loud heart noises in my head.

## Progress Summary

Day 5 on the normal ward:

* ✅ Managing post-operative headaches
* ✅ Continuing with mobile pacemaker for elevated heart rate monitoring
* ✅ Increased walking and stair climbing
* ✅ First Fit Bit heart point post-surgery
* ✅ Multiple physiotherapy sessions
* ✅ Improved dietary options
* ⏳ Monitoring elevated heart rate (common in younger valve replacement patients)

The elevated heart rate episodes are concerning but apparently normal for younger patients after valve replacement. The medical team's approach of increased hydration and walking, combined with pacemaker monitoring, provides reassurance that this is a manageable aspect of recovery.

## Day 6: Thursday, 9th October 2025

Day 6 was largely a continuation of Day 5's routine, with the medical team continuing to monitor and adjust my treatment plan.

### Ongoing Tachycardia Management

The team are still deciding on the correct medication to address my tachycardia. The situation is complicated by a one-off momentary pause that was caught on my continual monitoring. Whilst apparently not super uncommon in post-operative valve replacement patients, it does deserve additional monitoring. This is causing the decision-making process to take a bit longer than initially expected.

The combination of elevated heart rate (tachycardia) along with the single brief pause means the medical team need to balance the medication carefully - they want to control the rapid heart rate without potentially causing more pauses.

### Routine Continues

The day followed a similar pattern to Day 5:

* Morning checks and monitoring
* Continued physiotherapy sessions
* Walking exercises throughout the ward
* Breathing exercises with the respiratory exerciser
* Regular medication and vital sign monitoring

The focus remains on maintaining mobility whilst the cardiac team fine-tunes the medication protocol. The mobile pacemaker continues to provide reassurance and detailed monitoring data to help guide treatment decisions.

## Progress Summary Days 5-6

Key developments over these two days:

* ✅ Established routine on normal ward
* ✅ Consistent physiotherapy and mobility work
* ✅ Achieved first post-surgery fitness milestone
* ⏳ Medical team carefully evaluating medication options for tachycardia
* ⏳ Additional monitoring due to single momentary pause event
* ⏳ Continued mobile pacemaker monitoring

Whilst the medication decision is taking longer than expected, this careful approach demonstrates the thoroughness of the cardiac team in managing the nuances of post-operative recovery, particularly in younger valve replacement patients where heart rhythm variations can occur.

## Reflections on Progress

Over Days 5 and 6, there's been steady progress in mobility and establishing a ward routine, even though the heart rhythm management is proving more complex than anticipated. The elevated heart rate coupled with the momentary pause requires careful medication balancing.

The ability to climb a full flight of stairs and earn that first fitness point on Day 5 felt like a real achievement, even if it came with some uncomfortable sensations. The physiotherapy team's consistent attention and the medical team's thorough approach to medication selection help maintain confidence that these temporary challenges are part of the normal healing process for someone my age going through this procedure.

The next updates may come after a few days, once there are significant developments - particularly regarding the move to Kirchberg and any new treatment decisions.
