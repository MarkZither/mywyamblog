# Brew Day

As a birthday present Christophe, the lead brewer at [cha](https://untappd.com/chabrew), gave me the chance to have my very own beer created.

Since I moved to Luxembourg I have grown to like Belgian Blondes like [Brugse Zot](https://www.brugsezot.be/en/our-beers/brugse-zot-blond) and Trappist ales like [Orval](https://homebrewanswers.com/orval-clone-recipe/), so with my preferred flavour profile Christophe created a [recipe on GrainFather](https://community.grainfather.com/recipes/950024), a Belgian Blonde inspired beer with a higher [EBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Reference_Method#EBC) and hopefully not too much banana.

## The welcome

Before brewing we were treated to home made bread, honey from [](https://bybei.lu/), ham, cheese, fruits and yoghurts, important to have a good feed before brewing, it is a not a short process and it is important to eat before trying the previous brews for future inspiration.

## Hydration and energy

It is important to keep hydrated and energised while doing doing taxing jobs like water chemistry calculations and cranking the handle on the grain mill, we started that with a [david629801](https://untappd.com/b/cha-david629801/5312571), one of [cha's](https://untappd.com/chabrew) previous brews, a fine West coast IPA to wake up the taste buds.

## The water

Water makes up over 90% of beer and the levels of sulphates and chloride in the water will in part dictate the dryness, roundness and fullness of the beer.

This goes into the GrainMaster to come up to 66c ready for the mash.

## The milling

The recipe calls for 4 `fermentables`, that is a grain which will provide the sugars for the yeast to ferment, we will be using;
* Pale Ale Malt - 3.330 kg
* Pilsner Malt - 3.330 kg
* Munich Malt - Dark - 0.700 kg
* Caramel 100 - 38L - 0.150 kg

Each bring different different characteristics to the beer.
