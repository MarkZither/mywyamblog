# Binary Identification
In the Pentest reports I have read it has been common for the first section to be about identifying the technology the application is written in, this is used to make some initial suggestions on shortcomings in the application.

For me, as a .NET developer writing WPF applications, it was surprising to see it be reported repeatedly that our application was discovered to be written in Microsoft Visual C++ 8 and that we failed to implement protection like SafeSEH and ControlFlowGuard.

As much as I wanted to say wanted to say we don't write our software in C++ so these findings were not valid I dug deeper into the reports to understand why multiple pentests by multiple suppliers returned the same result.
