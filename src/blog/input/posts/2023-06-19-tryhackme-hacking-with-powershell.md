### Task 1 -  Objectives

Start the machine, that's it.

### Task 2 - What is Powershell?

[PowerShell verbs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7)


#### Question 1

What is the command to get a new object?

##### Notes

This confused me because the command is not a real command, just an example of how command naming works in PowerShell.

Running the command in PowerShell results in

``` powershell
PS C:\Users\mburton> ???-???
???-???: The term '???-???' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```
