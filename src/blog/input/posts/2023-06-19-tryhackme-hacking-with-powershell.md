## Hacking with PowerShell

This is a Try Hack Me premium room so to access it you will need a subscription, if you don't have one go get one with my [Referral Link](https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=638ca30a6675850049e4858e)

### Task 1 -  Objectives

Start the machine, that's it.

### Task 2 - What is Powershell?

[PowerShell verbs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7)


#### Question 1

What is the command to get a new object?

##### Notes

This confused me because the command is not a real command, just an example of how command naming works in PowerShell.

Running the command in PowerShell results in

``` powershell
PS C:\Users\mburton> ???-???
???-???: The term '???-???' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

### Task 3 - Basic Powershell Commands

[PowerShell verbs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7)


#### Question 1

What is the location of the file "interesting-file.txt"

##### Notes

The Microsoft Scripting Blog has lots of useful articles on working with PowerShell to answer this question you can read "[Use Windows PowerShell to search for files](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/use-windows-powershell-to-search-for-files/)".

``` powershell
Get-Childitem â€“Path C:\ -Include interesting-file.txt -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    Directory: C:\??????? ?????


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

#### Question 3

How many cmdlets are installed on the system(only cmdlets, not functions and aliases)?

##### Notes

The task intro shows that `Get-Command` can be used to get this information, but it returns `Cmdlets`, `Functions` and `Alias`, so how to filter only `Cmdlets`?

First check the help, examples and use the [online help](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-command?view=powershell-7.3&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-6) if it is not available locally 

``` powershell
> Get-Help Get-Command

NAME
    Get-Command

SYNTAX
    Get-Command [[-ArgumentList] <Object[]>] [-Verb <string[]>] [-Noun <string[]>] [-Module <string[]>]
    [-FullyQualifiedModule <ModuleSpecification[]>] [-TotalCount <int>] [-Syntax] [-ShowCommandInfo] [-All]
    [-ListImported] [-ParameterName <string[]>] [-ParameterType <PSTypeName[]>]  [<CommonParameters>]

    Get-Command [[-Name] <string[]>] [[-ArgumentList] <Object[]>] [-Module <string[]>] [-FullyQualifiedModule
    <ModuleSpecification[]>] [-CommandType {Alias | Function | Filter | Cmdlet | ExternalScript | Application | Script
    | Workflow | Configuration | All}] [-TotalCount <int>] [-Syntax] [-ShowCommandInfo] [-All] [-ListImported]
    [-ParameterName <string[]>] [-ParameterType <PSTypeName[]>]  [<CommonParameters>]


ALIASES
    gcm


REMARKS
    Get-Help cannot find the Help files for this cmdlet on this computer. It is displaying only partial help.
        -- To download and install Help files for the module that includes this cmdlet, use Update-Help.
        -- To view the Help topic for this cmdlet online, type: "Get-Help Get-Command -Online" or
           go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113309.
```

One of the parameters is `-CommandType` which accepts specific values from a list including `Cmdlet` so last step is to get a count, which can be done by piping it to `Measure-Object`.

``` powershell
> Get-Command -Type cmdlet | Measure-Object
```

Get the MD5 hash of interesting-file.txt

##### Notes

``` powershell
> Get-Help Get-FileHash

NAME
    Get-FileHash

SYNTAX
    Get-FileHash [-Path] <string[]> [-Algorithm {SHA1 | SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA512 | MACTripleDES | MD5 | RIPEMD160}]
    [<CommonParameters>]

    Get-FileHash -LiteralPath <string[]> [-Algorithm {SHA1 | SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA512 | MACTripleDES | MD5 |
    RIPEMD160}]  [<CommonParameters>]

    Get-FileHash -InputStream <Stream> [-Algorithm {SHA1 | SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA512 | MACTripleDES | MD5 | RIPEMD160}]
